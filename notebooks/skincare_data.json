This may include terpenes- other cannabinoids (such as CBG- CBN- or CBC)- flavonoids- and fatty acids. \n-Broad-spectrum CBD: Contains CBD plus other compounds from the hemp plant. THC is removed. These compounds are thought to work together to provide a synergistic effect.

Triple-tested product for potency and contaminants* \n4. Publicly available Certificate of Analysis (COA) of the final formula from the manufacturer.\n5. Compliant with Clean at Sephora standards.  \n \nFine print:\n-Full-spectrum CBD: Contains CBD plus other compounds from the hemp plant. Less than 0.3% THC in the finished product which is non-psychoactive. These compounds are thought to work together to provide a synergistic effect. This may include terpenes- other cannabinoids (such as CBG- CBN- or CBC)- flavonoids- and fatty acids. \n-Broad-spectrum CBD: Contains CBD plus other compounds from the hemp plant. THC is removed. These compounds are thought to work together to provide a synergistic effect. This may include terpenes- other cannabinoids (such as CBG- CBN- or CBC)- flavonoids- and fatty acids. \n-CBD Isolate: A refined powder that has been stripped down to contain virtually pure CBD.  No other compounds of the hemp plant are included. \n-Testing: Every batch is tested three times. Testing is done on the raw hemp- the cannabinoid extract- and the final formula when manufactured. Testing confirms the product has no less CBD (in mg) than claimed on the label.
